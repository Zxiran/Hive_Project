12. average weekly response time for each agent

# STEP 1:
# To solve this query  UDF dateformat.py was created so that date can be in the format of YYYY-MM-DD. That format enables us to use hive built-in fn "date_format()" which returns us the week of the month which is essential to solve the query


# Creating the orc table

STEP 2:

# Transforming the time to sec and storing it in table for calculating the avg response time of each agent

add file file:///home/cloudera/project_1/scripts/timeinsec.py;

# Create orc table for transformed date time 

     create table transformed_agent_performance_orc
